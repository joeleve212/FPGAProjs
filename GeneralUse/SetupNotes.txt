Starting to look at setup of project icestorm:

Project Icestorm is the general name for everything put together, link has info/links at bottom for more stuff: 
https://clifford.at/icestorm
Includes Yosys, nextpnr, and IceStorm 

Yosys:https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys
Nextpnr:

Future boards to maybe get:https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic


Notes on how to use FPGA tools:


Install directions used for apio:
https://nandland.com/set-up-apio-fpga-build-and-program/

Ice studio may be helpful in the future - has graphical stuff. Mentioned here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtkQ84Euyww&ab_channel=DigiKey


Upload to board with apio:
- use CMD as admin (maybe can do admin of git bash/cygwin?)
- Upload to board command: apio  upload --board Alchitry-Cu -p folderContainingSourceFile


There are executables in Documents/softwareInstalls/oss-cad-suite/bin - 
I think I installed that stuff improperly though, I can only run gtkwave through command line call



12/27 problem:
$ apio  upload --board Alchitry-Cu -p .
Info: No apio.ini file

---> WARNING: no PCF file found (.pcf)

yosys -p "synth_ice40 -top main -json hardware.json" -q boardVerify.v
ERROR: Module `main' not found!
scons: *** [hardware.json] Error 1


New approach- I went to achitry's site https://alchitry.com/boards/cu/#open-source-tools 
and foudn that they officially recommend iceCube2 as the software: https://www.latticesemi.com/icecube2#_4351BE10BA504435B5226390CF5D7D4C
This software installs nicely, but immediately yells at me that I don't have a license. I have to email them to get a free hobbyist license. 


Waited to get the response, followed instructions and setup license without problem. I also found Alchitry Labs software that I should've found from the sparkfun page at the beginning. https://alchitry.com/alchitry-labs/
Installed that, including the Java necessary and now I'm able to build and load code to the board!

I noticed in Alchitry Labs, there was a contraints file that only provided the base board's LEDs and RST button, so I found the acf file for the IO board here: https://github.com/alchitry/Alchitry-Labs/blob/master/library/components/io.acf


Coming back to this a day later(computer in sleep mode, not shut down),
I cannot build. 
Fails with this error:
Bin file (C:\Users\joele\Documents\GHrepos\FPGAProjs\initialTests\initialProj\work\alchitry_imp\sbt\outputs\bitmap\cu_top_0_bitmap.bin) could not be found! The build probably failed

Searched online to find others have seen this problem for at least 2 years:
https://github.com/alchitry/Alchitry-Labs/issues/31

Ran this command in  /c/lscc/iCEcube2.2020.12  :
find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's|^#!/bin/sh/|#!/bin/bash|g'

took awhile, finally finished, and now I can't run iceCube2 at all. build fails with same issue as before as well as this:
This version of C:\lscc\iCEcube2.2020.12\sbt_backend\bin\win32\opt\synpwrap\synpwrap.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information and then contact the software publisher.

Trying to revert my change by running:
find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's|^#!/bin/bash|#!/bin/sh/|g'

did not work. RIP, will have to reinstall icecube and find different solution

========
After reinstalling icecube to get toolchain back to where it was, still didn't work.

After fiddling around for a while, found that Alchitry Labs is the problem. 
It seems to not want to build if the software is left open for a long time? Could be different trigger
Once a project "can't find cu_top_0_bitmap.bin", it's never going to work. 
A new project can build fine, so that's the work around for now - copy/paste work into new project when ready to build.
