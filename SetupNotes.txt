Starting to look at setup of project icestorm:

Project Icestorm is the general name for everything put together, link has info/links at bottom for more stuff: 
https://clifford.at/icestorm

Future boards to maybe get:https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic


Notes on how to use FPGA tools:


Install directions used for apio:

Ice studio may be helpful in the future - has graphical stuff. Mentioned here:

Upload to board with apio:
- use CMD as admin (maybe can do admin of git bash/cygwin?)
- Upload to board command: apio  upload --board Alchitry-Cu -p folderContainingSourceFile


There are executables in Documents/softwareInstalls/oss-cad-suite/bin - 
I think I installed that stuff improperly though, I can only run gtkwave through command line call



12/27 problem:
$ apio  upload --board Alchitry-Cu -p .
Info: No apio.ini file
